# A jekyll-powered port of [Obtvse](https://github.com/natew/obtvse)
================================

This is a quick and dirty port of Obtvse to Jeykll. Please help me fix things!

### Setup
--------------------------------
For the links to work, you'll need to change the variables at the top of the default.html layout to whatever you want them to be. (If you leave them blank, they won't appear.)
They are:
name: yourname
tagline: This is my tagline!
twitter: yourname
github: yourname
email: yourname@yourdomain.com
website: yourdomain.com

I'm sure there's a better way to do this, but I don't have very much experience with jekyll.

### Creating Posts
Posts only need two variables: "layout" (which should probably always be "post", unless you want to create a new one), and "title".

...that's about it. Wasn't that easy?

### License
---------------------------------
This software is licensed under the MIT-License, as is Obtvse.
